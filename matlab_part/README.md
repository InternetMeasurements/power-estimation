# MATLAB Data Processing and Modeling Scripts

This folder contains MATLAB scripts and supporting files for data processing, feature extraction, and energy consumption modeling. It also includes associated figures and model outputs.

## Folder Structure

### `data/`
- Contains raw experimental data and the `grouped_experiment` data.
- Data is organized using the `organize_experiments.py` script.

### `results/`
- Stores outputs generated by MATLAB, such as:
  - `aggregated_features`
  - Trained model files
  - Enriched feature tables and figures

## Main Scripts

### `correlation_test.m`
- Computes the correlation matrix of input features.
- Identifies and removes highly correlated variables (threshold â‰¥ 90%).
- Visualizes correlation matrices before and after feature reduction.

### `data_processing.m`
- Processes raw data, extracts features, and cleans `aggregated_features` by removing rows with NaN values.
- Saves the processed data to the `results` folder.

### `sequential_fs.m`
- Performs sequential forward feature selection using experiment-aware cross-validation.
- Identifies the optimal subset of features for modeling.

### `sliding_window_processing.m`
- Generates `aggregated_features_enriched` tables.
- Incorporates lagged features up to 12 bins (6 seconds) earlier to capture temporal dependencies.

### `train_cnn_energy_model.m`
- Trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to estimate mean power consumption from extracted features.

Make sure to run the scripts in the recommended order and validate intermediate outputs for consistency.
